# AI-Powered Memory Capsule Platform PRD

## Project Information
- Project Name: memory_capsule_platform
- Technology Stack: React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Blockchain (Ethereum/Polygon), IPFS

### Original Requirements
A platform that uses AI to create, preserve, and share hyper-personalized "memory capsules" in a decentralized, user-owned ecosystem. The platform transforms various types of user inputs into interactive, evolving narratives while ensuring privacy and data ownership through blockchain technology.

## Product Definition

### Product Goals
1. Enable users to create and preserve digital memories with AI-enhanced storytelling and visualization
2. Ensure complete user ownership and privacy through decentralized storage and blockchain technology
3. Transform raw memory data into interactive, evolving narratives that become more valuable over time

### User Stories
1. As a privacy-conscious user, I want to store my personal memories in a decentralized system so that I maintain complete ownership and control of my data
2. As a digital creator, I want to transform my photos and recordings into AI-enhanced interactive experiences so that I can share more meaningful stories with my loved ones
3. As a family historian, I want to preserve important memories with guaranteed permanence so that future generations can access our family's legacy
4. As a regular user, I want to easily input various types of data (photos, voice, text) and have AI automatically create engaging narratives so that I can save time while creating meaningful memory capsules

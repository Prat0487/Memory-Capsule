Guide for Building and Pitching a PoC/MVP for Pre-Seed Funding

1. Budget Constraints and Leveraging AI Tools

Budget Considerations:
The expected expenditure is approximately ₹60L – ₹82L (US$75k – US$100k) over six months, but using AI-powered tools (e.g., Sourcegraph Cody) and lean development strategies can reduce upfront costs significantly 
.

Leveraging AI & Outsourcing:
• Utilize AI coding assistants to generate boilerplate code, unit tests, documentation, and optimization suggestions.
• Outsource specialized tasks such as smart contract architecture or advanced AI model tuning to freelancers or part-time experts.
• Use AI tools to quickly fill any technical knowledge gaps rather than hiring specialized roles 
 
.


2. Lean Team Composition and Cost-Saving Strategies

Team Composition:
• A lean in-house core consisting of a full-stack developer, a versatile engineer for AI and Web3 integrations, and a part-time/freelance UI/UX designer.
• Utilize open-source technologies like React and TailwindCSS to minimize licensing fees 
.

Open-Source and Cloud Credits:
• Adopt free and open-source solutions (e.g., IPFS for decentralized storage).
• Leverage cloud providers' free tiers and startup credits to keep operating costs low 
.


3. Pre-Seed Funding Options and Readiness Factors

Funding Avenues:
• Angel Investors/Networks: Examples include AngelList syndicates, Mumbai Angels, and Band of Angels. They invest year-round based on deal flow 
.
• Specialized Pre-Seed Funds: Examples include Forum Ventures, Backstage Capital, Hustle Fund, and Precursor Ventures. They have multiple open deal cycles throughout the year 
.
• Startup Accelerators: Examples include Y Combinator, Techstars, and 500 Global, with set application windows (e.g., YC Winter and Summer batches) 
 
.
• Corporate Venture Arms: Such as Microsoft’s M12 or Samsung’s Catalyst Fund, which often pitch year-round or during special calls 
.
• University Incubators and Government Grants: For instance, funds and incubators affiliated with MIT or Stanford, or programs like Startup India Seed Fund 
.

When Funding is Pursued:
Pre-seed funding is generally available when you have:
• A Proof of Concept (PoC) or minimal viable product (MVP) showing early evidence of product-market fit.
• A strong founding team and a clear market opportunity – ideally in emerging sectors like AI, blockchain, or digital health 
 
.


4. Steps to Build a PoC/MVP

Leverage Existing Files & Structure:
• Use provided documentation (e.g., market_research.json, prd.json) as a roadmap for features.
• Focus on P0 features such as basic user onboarding, a simple “create capsule” flow for text and/or images, and minimal AI integration 
.

Establish a Clear Architecture:

Front-End: Develop a clean user flow with pages for landing, user sign-up/login, and displaying memory capsules using frameworks like React and Tailwind CSS.
Back-End / Web3 Integration: Build a minimal Node.js/Express server or use serverless functions to accept user data and store it on IPFS 
 
.
Integrate Basic AI Functionality:
• Implement simple AI features using hosted AI services (e.g., GPT-based APIs) to generate narratives from user input.
• Keep AI functionalities minimal to demonstrate core value without incurring heavy overhead 
.

Use AI-Powered Tools for Development:
• Utilize tools like Sourcegraph Cody to generate components, tests, and documentation.
• Leverage AI code reviews to identify optimization and security improvements 
.

Demonstrate Key User Flows:
• Show a quick demo covering user sign-up/login, content upload, AI-generated narratives, storage on IPFS, and proof of ownership through a “Share or Retrieve” option 
.

Cost Management:
• Deploy on affordable platforms (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) and utilize free-tier services (e.g., public IPFS gateways, free plans from Pinata or Infura).
• Use per-token based AI services instead of hosting entire models 
.

Feedback and Iteration:
• Roll out the MVP to a beta testing group or advisors.
• Collect feedback, prioritize user-driven changes, and refine the UI/UX and analytics incrementally 
.


5. Pitching Your PoC/MVP to Pre-Seed Investors

Tailor Your Pitch:
• Begin with a clear narrative on the market problem and how your solution (memory capsule platform) addresses it.
• Highlight the lean approach you’ve taken to build the PoC/MVP, emphasizing reduced costs and streamlined development using AI tools 
.

Demonstrate Technical Feasibility & Early Traction:
• Showcase the working demo with key user flows: user registrations, content uploads, AI-generated narratives, and decentralized data storage.
• Present early user or beta tester feedback to further validate your approach 
.

Emphasize Readiness:
• Detail your future roadmap with prioritized milestones, showing a clear plan for scaling and adding advanced features post-funding.
• Mention any affiliations with accelerators, advisors, or mentors that could expedite further investment 
.

Prepare Detailed Documentation:
• Include technical architecture, cost management strategies, and market research findings to build investor confidence.
• Provide a clear plan for the use of funds, emphasizing rapid iteration and feedback loops for continued product development 
.


This logical guide structures your journey from budgeting and lean development through building a PoC/MVP, to finally pitching to pre-seed funding companies with clear, actionable steps.

Let me create a comprehensive analysis of the Memory-Capsule project based on what we've learned through our work on it. I'll organize this into several key sections:

Key Features Achieved
Technical Challenges Faced and Resolved
Key Learnings from the Project
Future Roadmap for Enhancement
For each section, I'll provide detailed technical observations and insights.

Memory-Capsule Project Analysis
Features Achieved
The Memory-Capsule platform has successfully implemented several core features:

Decentralized Storage Integration:

Seamless IPFS integration for permanent, content-addressed storage
Successful Pinata API implementation for reliable pinning and persistence
Content-addressed URLs that remain valid indefinitely
Multi-Service Architecture:

Clean separation of concerns with specialized microservices
Independent scaling capabilities for each service component
Service discovery and inter-service communication patterns
Full Memory Lifecycle Management:

Creation flow with multi-file uploads
Structured metadata storage in Supabase
Retrieval by wallet address for personalized experiences
Memory details display with rich media content
Responsive User Experience:

Clean React components with proper state management
Adaptive loading states for asynchronous operations
Intuitive error handling for user guidance
Optimistic UI updates with background synchronization
Technical Challenges & Solutions
Microservice Communication Challenges:

Challenge: Services couldn't reliably discover and communicate with each other
Solution: Proper Docker networking and service naming conventions
Data Format Consistency:

Challenge: Mismatched field names between services (camelCase vs. snake_case)
Solution: Standardized data transformation layers between service boundaries
IPFS Propagation Delays:

Challenge: New content not immediately available via gateway URLs
Solution: Intelligent retry logic with progressive backoff for new uploads
Database Schema Mismatches:

Challenge: Code attempting to insert with incorrect column names
Solution: Explicit data mapping to match Supabase schema requirements
Module Export/Import Patterns:

Challenge: Inconsistent use of named vs. default exports causing build failures
Solution: Standardized export patterns across component boundaries
Key Learnings

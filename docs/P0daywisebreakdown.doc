Let's analyze the documents and create a clear action plan:

Current Status: ✅ Modern UI implemented (glass effects, responsive design) ✅ Basic wallet connection ✅ Form components for memory creation

Next Actions Based on P0 Requirements:

IPFS Integration (Week 1)
import { create } from 'ipfs-http-client'

const ipfs = create({
  host: 'ipfs.infura.io',
  port: 5001,
  protocol: 'https'
});

export const uploadToIPFS = async (files) => {
  const uploadPromises = files.map(async (file) => {
    const buffer = await file.arrayBuffer();
    const result = await ipfs.add(buffer);
    return result.path;
  });
  return Promise.all(uploadPromises);
};

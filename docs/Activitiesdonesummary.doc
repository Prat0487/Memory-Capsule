• Set up a React + Vite project with Tailwind CSS for the frontend.
• Created a basic wallet connection logic (using ethers.js/MetaMask).
• Implemented IPFS uploads using Pinata (with an ipfs.js service).
• Created a simple Node/Express server to handle memories creation and retrieval.
• Added Supabase integration for storing metadata in a “memories” table.
• Dealt with schema mismatches (ownerAddress vs. owneraddress, ipfsHash casing, etc.).
• Resolved multiple 500 errors by aligning column names in the database with the JSON payload.
• Established a minimal flow: upload file to IPFS → store metadata in Supabase → fetch memories.

Memory Capsule: Project Progress Summary
We've successfully implemented and refined several critical components of the Memory Capsule platform:

Wallet Integration
Implemented MetaMask wallet connection with proper error handling
Created a polished wallet display that shows truncated address and ETH balance
Added authentication gating that requires wallet connection to view memories
Memory Display System
Built a responsive memory gallery that renders memory cards from Supabase
Fixed image rendering to display full, uncropped images in proper containers
Implemented proper filtering of memories based on wallet address
Supabase Database Integration
Replaced mock data storage with real Supabase backend integration
Created proper data fetching with error handling and loading states
Implemented memory sharing functionality with shareable links
User Experience Improvements
Added a "View Full Memory" button that opens detailed views in new tabs
Created clear user messaging for different states (no wallet, no memories, etc.)
Enhanced visual styling with proper spacing, rounded corners, and responsive grid
Technical Foundations
Established consistent naming conventions across components and context
Implemented proper React patterns with useEffect dependencies and conditional rendering
Added detailed console logging for debugging and development clarity
This work has transformed the project from a prototype into a functional web3 application where users can connect their Ethereum wallets, view their memories in a visually appealing gallery, and share those memories with others through generated links. The foundation is now set for future enhancements like multi-chain support or advanced memory management features.

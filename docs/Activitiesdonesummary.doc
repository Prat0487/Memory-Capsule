• Set up a React + Vite project with Tailwind CSS for the frontend.
• Created a basic wallet connection logic (using ethers.js/MetaMask).
• Implemented IPFS uploads using Pinata (with an ipfs.js service).
• Created a simple Node/Express server to handle memories creation and retrieval.
• Added Supabase integration for storing metadata in a “memories” table.
• Dealt with schema mismatches (ownerAddress vs. owneraddress, ipfsHash casing, etc.).
• Resolved multiple 500 errors by aligning column names in the database with the JSON payload.
• Established a minimal flow: upload file to IPFS → store metadata in Supabase → fetch memories.

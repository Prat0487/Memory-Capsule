Below is a proposed roadmap for completing the P0 (Must-have) tasks listed in prd.json. These tasks are considered the foundational features required for a minimal viable product (MVP):

Secure User Authentication and Wallet Integration
a. Research & Framework Selection
• Choose an appropriate Web3 library or SDK (e.g., ethers.js, web3.js) for wallet connectivity.
• Decide on the main authentication approach. For instance, signing messages with users’ wallets or using an OAuth approach (if bridging Web2 and Web3 accounts) while still retaining Web3 functionality.

b. Implementation Steps
• Implement wallet connection UI (e.g., “Connect Wallet” button) in the React frontend.
• Allow users to sign and verify messages (to confirm ownership of the wallet).
• Link this to a backend session or a client-side session to maintain a stable user state.

c. Testing & Security
• Test different wallet providers (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) on both desktop and mobile.
• Ensure secure handling of potential phishing or signature replay attacks.
• Set up thorough unit and integration tests, especially around authentication flows.

Basic Memory Upload (Photos, Text, Audio)
a. Define the Upload Flow
• Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to drag-and-drop or select media.
• Support photos, text, and audio.
• Provide progress feedback (e.g., loading spinners, progress bars).

b. Implement Upload Functionality
• Use React hooks/components to handle file selection and preview.
• Validate file types (images, audio) and text input.
• Decide on initial location for file storage (potentially staging on a server or local client before pushing to IPFS).

c. User Experience Considerations
• Limit file size for performance or outline how to handle large files.
• Provide warnings or fallback if file type is unsupported.
• Build a clean UI/UX with instructions or tooltips for new users.

IPFS Storage Integration
a. Set Up IPFS Integration
• Spin up an IPFS node (locally or use a third-party IPFS pinning service like Pinata or Infura).
• Create utility functions to upload files to IPFS from the frontend (and optionally a backend).

b. Data Management & Metadata
• Decide how to manage metadata—store minimal data on-chain (e.g., IPFS content hash) and the rest off-chain.
• Structure the data for future retrieval (folder or naming conventions).

c. Testing & Reliability
• Test IPFS calls under various network conditions.
• Ensure files remain pinned or that a pinning service is reliably maintaining them.
• Keep a fallback plan if IPFS nodes are temporarily unreachable.

AI-Powered Memory Enhancement
a. MVP AI Feature Scope
• Start with a simple AI pipeline—e.g., a basic text summarization or image captioning model.
• Use a third-party API or an open-source model to handle small-scale transformations first.

b. Integration Steps
• Create or use an existing microservice that can receive uploaded content and return the “enhanced” output (e.g., a short descriptive narrative of a photo, or noise reduction in an audio clip).
• Connect the AI microservice to the main platform for a seamless upload → AI processing → result pipeline.

c. Scalability & Next Steps
• For later expansions, consider refining the narrative generation steps or adding more advanced features (e.g., style-based generation, multi-lingual support).
• Optimize for performance (caching, model fine-tuning).

Basic Sharing Capabilities
a. Sharing Options
• Determine how capsules can be shared—e.g., a link with access control (token-based or signature-based).
• Consider the user flow for “public” vs. “private” sharing.

b. Access Control
• For a Web3 approach, consider NFT-based ownership or a standard token gating approach (only certain wallet addresses can view).
• Alternatively, generate unique share links that reference the IPFS hash with optional encryption keys.

c. UI/UX Implementation
• Add a “Share” button next to each memory capsule.
• Allow the user to copy the link or share it directly to social media.
• Provide clear indications if a capsule is public or private.

Mobile-Responsive Interface
a. Mobile-First Layouts
• Ensure the React components use responsive layouts (e.g., Tailwind CSS grid, flex utilities).
• Test on common screen sizes to confirm usability.

b. Wallet & Web3 Interactions on Mobile
• Validate that wallet connectivity (e.g., WalletConnect/MetaMask mobile) works seamlessly.
• Ensure uploading photos, text, and audio from a mobile device is a smooth experience.

c. Testing & Iteration
• Regularly run tests on real devices and mobile simulators.
• Optimize for performance on slower connections.

PHASED PROJECT TIMELINE (Suggested)
• Phase 1 (Week 1–2):
– Implement basic UI with wallet integration.
– Set up IPFS node or pinning service.
– Prepare file upload flow (photos, text, audio).

• Phase 2 (Week 3–4):
– Integrate IPFS uploads in the upload flow.
– Set up the AI microservice (initial minimal AI functionality like caption generation).
– Integrate AI pipeline with upload.

• Phase 3 (Week 5–6):
– Develop basic sharing features (link generation or token gating).
– Implement a mobile-responsive layout.
– Conduct end-to-end testing on both desktop and mobile.

• Phase 4 (Week 7–8):
– Bug fixing, performance optimizations, user acceptance testing.
– Prepare documentation for each major feature.
– Launch MVP to select testers or early adopters.

This roadmap provides a structured approach to delivering the must-have (P0) features, ensuring a smooth user experience, secure ownership via Web3 integrations, and the foundation of AI-powered memory enhancement. After completing these priorities, the team can proceed to P1 and P2 features outlined in the PRD.

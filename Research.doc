One effective path when budget is tight is to build a leaner MVP while leveraging AI-assisted development tools (like Sourcegraph Cody) to minimize time and labor costs. Below are practical steps you can follow:

Focus on a Core MVP Feature Set: • Prioritize only must-have (P0) features from your PRD—e.g., user onboarding, basic memory upload, minimal AI enhancement, and fundamental Web3 functionality for ownership.
• Postpone advanced or niche features (e.g., collaborative spaces, 3D views) until your initial product gains traction or attracts funding.

Use an AI-Powered Development Workflow: • Employ AI coding assistants (like Sourcegraph Cody) to generate boilerplate code, unit tests, or refactoring suggestions, accelerating development while reducing the need for additional junior devs.
• Take advantage of auto-generated documentation and code examples from AI tools to streamline the learning curve for new technologies or libraries you integrate.

Outsource Specialized Tasks: • If a full-time Blockchain or AI engineer is out of budget, consider short-term contracts or freelancers for highly specialized tasks—particularly smart contract architecture or advanced AI model tuning.
• Hire part-time QA or rely on automated testing (with AI support) to reduce the need for a dedicated QA engineer early on.

Lean Team Composition: • A minimal in-house core might include: – One full-stack developer comfortable with both front-end (React) and back-end tasks.
– One versatile engineer who can handle basic integrations of AI APIs and Web3.
– A part-time or freelance UI/UX resource to ensure the product is intuitive despite having minimal features.
• Rely on AI tools to fill knowledge gaps quickly instead of hiring multiple specialized roles.

Open-Source and Cloud Credits: • TailwindCSS, React, and IPFS are free and open-source, reducing both licensing expenses and overhead.
• Many cloud providers and AI platforms (like Google Cloud, AWS, or Microsoft Azure) offer free tiers or startup credits to support new projects.
• Some Web3 infrastructure providers likewise offer grants or test tokens to encourage usage.

Phased Approach with Feedback Loops: • Release small increments to a limited user group or beta testers. Collect feedback to refine the product and pivot early if necessary.
• This iterative approach not only reduces wasted effort but also helps you find a market fit without investing heavily upfront.

Seek Grants or Pre-Seed Funding: • Explore blockchain-related grants (Polygon, Ethereum Foundation grants, etc.) for Web3 projects.
• Sign up for incubators or accelerator programs that provide funding, resources, and mentorship—sometimes in exchange for a small equity stake.

Maintain a Practical Roadmap: • Keep your milestones simple: build only what is needed to demonstrate value and viability.
• Push non-essential enhancements (like complex AI personalization or advanced privacy controls) into future phases unless they are truly core to your offering.

By focusing on a lean feature set and harnessing AI development tools, you improve productivity, shorten time-to-market, and reduce upfront cash requirements. This allows you to launch quickly, validate user interest, and secure additional funding, partnerships, or revenue to support further growth.

Below is a set of practical steps to help you build a focused proof-of-concept (PoC) or minimal viable product (MVP) for your AI-powered memory capsule platform, using the existing codebase context. These steps aim to demonstrate core functionality for pitching to pre-seed funders while keeping scope and resources lean.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Leverage Existing Files & Structure ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Memory-Capsule/docs (market_research.json, prd.json):
– Use these documents as your roadmap. You already have a solid overview of the features (P0, P1, P2) and the market opportunity.
– Prioritize a minimal set of P0 items, such as:
Basic user onboarding/login (with decentralized or standard auth).
Simple “create capsule” flow with text and/or an image.
IPFS or another decentralized storage integration for storing the capsule.
Basic AI-generated narrative (even if only a single style or limited in scope).
• Focus on securing “MVP readiness” by ensuring your code structure is coherent and modular. Don’t overcomplicate the platform with advanced features like interactive 3D viewers or token economics at this stage.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 2) Ensure a Clear Front-End & Back-End Division ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Front-End (e.g., React + Tailwind CSS):
– Present a clean, simple user flow:
1. Landing page → user logs in or signs up.
2. A “Create Capsule” form to upload text or images.
3. A “My Capsules” page to view saved memory capsules.

• Back-End / Web3 Integration (Node, IPFS, or third-party Blockchain APIs):
– A minimal Node.js/Express server (or serverless functions) that accepts user-submitted data.
– Storage logic that writes data to IPFS or a similar service.
– If you implement NFTs or on-chain ownership, keep it optional until you prove demand.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 3) Integrate Basic AI Functionality ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Even a small proof of concept with text-based AI can demonstrate value. For instance:
– Use a GPT-based API (OpenAI, Anthropic, or another model) to generate a short narrative from user-uploaded text or image descriptions.
– Store generated narratives on IPFS as part of the user’s memory capsule.
– Consider simplifying: Rather than building a robust AI pipeline, just call a hosted AI service to reduce development overhead.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 4) Utilize Sourcegraph Cody (and Other AI Tools) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Sourcegraph Cody can help automate boilerplate code creation and refactoring. You might:
– Ask Cody for initial React components or code snippets integrating IPFS in Node.js.
– Use Cody to generate basic tests or documentation.
– Let AI-based code review tools highlight performance pitfalls, best practices, or potential security vulnerabilities early on.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 5) Demonstrate Key User Flows ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • For the MVP demo (e.g., to potential pre-seed investors), ensure you can show:

User sign-up/login (Web2 or basic Web3 wallet connection).
Upload memory content (text, image).
AI-generated short narrative or summary.
Storage of the final capsule on IPFS (or a placeholder decentralized approach).
A “Share or Retrieve” option that shows proof of ownership or immutability.
This quick journey conveys both the vision and technical feasibility without detouring into complex features.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 6) Keep Costs in Check ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Host your MVP on low-cost or free tiers (e.g., Vercel or Netlify for front-end, free-tier for Node back-end if usage is light).
• Use public IPFS gateways initially, or services like Pinata, Infura, or Web3.storage that have generous free plans for small-scale proofs of concept.
• For AI, rely on per-token usage from a provider rather than building or hosting your own large models.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 7) Iterate & Gather Feedback ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Share the MVP with a small group of beta customers or advisors for design validation and improvement ideas.
• Maintain a feedback loop to prioritize changes that directly address user pain points or investor questions.
• Gradually refine the UI/UX, add user onboarding flows, and incorporate essential analytics to show usage metrics.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Summary ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── By focusing narrowly on P0 features—basic memory uploads, simple AI narratives, and decentralized storage—you can rapidly build a working PoC or MVP. Use Sourcegraph Cody and related AI tools to speed up development, reduce coding overhead, and maintain a robust structure. This tangible demonstration of your concept will make a meaningful impression on pre-seed investors, showcasing both technical feasibility and market viability without ballooning costs or timetable.

ok, now I have developed a PoC or MVP, now how to pitch to preseed funding companies and investors?
